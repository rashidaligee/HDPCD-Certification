Hive Join

    Write a Hive query in a file named Task12.hive that satisfies the following criteria:
        Use Tez as the execution engine
        The result of the query is in a new Hive-managed table named flights_weather stored as a textfile
        Join the flightdelays table with the sfo_weather table where dest or origin equals "SFO" in flightdelays, 
        and the year, month and dayofmonth are equal in the two tables
        Select all columns from the flightdelays table, and the temperature_max and temperature_min columns from sfo_weather
