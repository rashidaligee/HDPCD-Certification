==Use HCatalog with Pig==

    Write a Pig script Task08.pig that satisfies all of the following criteria:
        Run the Pig query using Tez as the execution engine
        Load the data from the flightdelays table in Hive using HCatalog
        Remove any rows where the arrdelay is less than or equal to 0
        Order the output by the arrdelay value descending
        Store the output as three comma-separated files in a new directory in HDFS named /user/horton/flightdelays_nonzero
